# Enron Email Fraud Detection

This project apply machine learning techniques to identify Enron employees who may have commited fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

This project involves:
* Dealing with imperfect, real-world dataset
* Feature creation, transformation and selection aka Feature engineering
* Validating and evaluating using quantitative metrics
* Compare the performance of differente machine learning algorithms
* Tune each machine learning algorithm for maximum performance
* Clearly communicate results

This project was part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.
